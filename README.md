      Bandada Boilerplate - Feedback App
    </h1>
</p>

| Create your unique identity, join a group and provide your feedback anonymously. |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

This application shows [Bandada](https://github.com/bandada-infra/bandada) usage with [Semaphore](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore) in order to signal anonymously inside a Semaphore-compatible offchain groups. You will be able to access one group without any restriction (_manual_) and the other only if you have a minimum required number of followers in your GitHub account. You can remove the association between your GitHub account and the Bandada application at any time, as indicated [here](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/maintaining-oauth-apps/deleting-an-oauth-app).

This project was created using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a framework for building React applications.

To learn more about Bandada and different types of groups, please visit the [repository](https://github.com/bandada-infra/bandada) and [documentation](https://pse-team.notion.site/Bandada-82d0d9d3c6b64b7bb2a09d4c7647c083?pvs=4). Also, you can learn more about the differences between Semaphore and Bandada [here](https://pse-team.notion.site/pse-team/Bandada-vs-Semaphore-00d4bb92c9684bc0b1340301fc594dc9).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Live Demo

The Feedback App is already deployed and configured with a manual offchain group and a credential offchain group.

You can begin interacting with both immediately without any additional configuration. Alternatively, you can watch a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use each application.

- Manual offchain group ([demo](https://demo.bandada.pse.dev/), [video](https://youtu.be/ji6E5ES8JcI))
- Credential offchain group ([demo](https://credential-bandada-semaphore.vercel.app/), [video](https://youtu.be/K_rAzjDPYyI))

## :classical_building: Architecture

![Bandada-Semaphore Offchain App Architecture](https://github.com/vplasencia/bandada-semaphore-demo/assets/52170174/b8d43564-01b3-4b7c-ae56-6efb1c5a8773)

## Use manual offchain group locally

**Please make sure you are on the `main` branch.**

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) >= v18.17.0
- A [supabase](https://supabase.com/) free tier project
- A local copy of [Bandada](https://github.com/bandada-infra/bandada)

## 1. ü™∂ Running Bandada locally

Clone the Bandada repository and follow the [README](https://github.com/bandada-infra/bandada/blob/main/README.md) to run it locally and create your first manual offchain group:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bandada-infra/bandada
```

## 2. üóÑÔ∏è Preparing Supabase

Supabase is an open source Firebase alternative. You can either use it online or self-hosted (no sign-up needed).

- Supabase online: create a [Supabase account](https://supabase.com/dashboard/sign-up) and a free tier project with basic configuration.
- Supabase self-hosting: follow [self-hosting using Docker](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker).

### Creating tables

Once your project is ready, access the `Table Editor` from your project dashboard (you can use the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development) if you prefer) and create the following tables with the columns as shown in the image:

- Store all feedback in the `feedback` table, which will store all feedback (= signals) sent from users (= identities).
- Store all nullifier hashes in the `nullifier_hash` table to prevent double signaling. Refer to the [Semaphore documentation](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/glossary#nullifier) for more information.
- Store all Semaphore group roots in the `root_history` table to fix the [Merkle Tree](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/issues/98) (= [Semaphore groups](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/issues/98)) roots expiration challenge. Refer to the [conversation](https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/semaphore/issues/98) on GitHub for more information.

![Tables schema](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26070dfe-189b-40f0-8ebd-f47e2a721350)

- When you are creating the tables make sure to uncheck the `Enable Row Level Security (RLS)` checkbox so that you can easily write to the database. If you have already created the tables, you can disable RLS by clicking the `Disable RLS` button. That's the quickest solution for working with the database but a real world application would have Row Level Security policies. You can learn more about it in the [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security).

## 3. üõ† Boilerplate Installation

Clone this repository running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bandada-infra/boilerplate
```

and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd boilerplate && yarn
```

## 4. üîß Boilerplate Configuration

Copy the environment variables for the development environment, run this command:

```bash
cp .env.development.local.example .env.development.local
```

Update their values:

```bash
# These can be retrieved from the Bandada dashboard (e.g., https://<dashboard_url>/groups/off-chain/<group_id>).
NEXT_PUBLIC_BANDADA_GROUP_ID=<bandada-group-id>
BANDADA_ADMIN_API_KEY=<bandada-admin-api-key>

# If using Supabase online, retrieve from dashboard (Project -> Settings -> API -> URL & Project API keys).
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_URL=<supabase-api-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<supabase-anon-key>
# If using Supabase self-hosted, these are the default parameters:
#NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
#NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyAgCiAgICAicm9sZSI6ICJzZXJ2aWNlX3JvbGUiLAogICAgImlzcyI6ICJzdXBhYmFzZS1kZW1vIiwKICAgICJpYXQiOiAxNjQxNzY5MjAwLAogICAgImV4cCI6IDE3OTk1MzU2MDAKfQ.DaYlNEoUrrEn2Ig7tqibS-PHK5vgusbcbo7X36XVt4Q

```

## 5. üìú Usage

To start the applications in a development environment, run the following command:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The Feedback and other apps will be deployed at the following URLs (without any changes to the default configurations):

- Bandada API: http://localhost:3000
- Bandada Dashboard: http://localhost:3001
- Feedback App: http://localhost:3003
